# Marine Debris Detection

This document contains:
- Description of the best performing model from the Omdena Project _Detecting Plastic Debris through Satellite Imagery in the Italian and Mediterranean Seas_.
- A short summary of the evaluation methodologies used in papers [1], [2] which we might want to replicate if we decide to pursue publication.
- A paragraph comparing our model with the Map-Mapper models
- A going-forward paragraph, highlighting the possible next steps
Aim of the document :
- It should serve as both a recap and a starting point for the analysis to determine whether we want to pursue publication

## Model Description
- Our model is based on the **ResAttUNet** architecture. In the original paper the model is trained on MARIDA and solves a multi-class problem. The metrics are inferior to Map-Mapper. We improve over it, but we transform the task to a **binary** task.
- Our Model is trained on a **combined dataset** composed of MARIDA and the imagery from the Litter Windrows Catalog that we collected and preprocessed ourselves.
- **Our Model merges MARIDA classes 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 (1. Marine Debris, 2. Dense Sargassum, 3. Sparse Sargassum, 4. Natural Organic Material, 9. Foam) to a unique plastic debris proxy- class, following the paper [1]**.
- A distinctive feature of the training pipeline is the random selection of non-debris pixels from an annular neighborhood surrounding the annotated debris pixels in the Litter Windrows Catalog Dataset. This strategy helps mitigate the inherent imbalance between debris and background pixels. Both the proportion of non-debris pixels sampled from the annular region and the radius of that region are treated as hyperparameters.
- The metrics, following literature, are computed on the annotated pixels of the MARIDA test set (no random choice happens for the MARIDA dataset).

# Flood Risk Assessment Using CHIRPS and Landsat Data in Sub-Basins

## 1. Introduction

Flooding poses a significant threat to many regions worldwide, including the Congo Basin. Effective flood risk management and mitigation require a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to flooding within specific sub-basins. This project utilizes a combination of CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) and Landsat data to analyze rainfall patterns and land cover changes to assess flood risk in various sub-basins.

By leveraging high-resolution precipitation data from CHIRPS and detailed land cover information from Landsat, the project aims to identify sub-basins most susceptible to flooding. This understanding is crucial for developing targeted strategies for flood risk reduction, including enhanced flood defenses, improved drainage infrastructure, and sustainable land management practices.

## 2. Background and Motivation

Flooding is a recurrent and devastating natural disaster that affects millions of people globally. Accurate flood risk assessment involves analyzing both climatic and land cover factors. CHIRPS provides high-resolution rainfall estimates, which are essential for identifying regions with significant precipitation. Landsat data offers detailed information on land use and land cover, which can be used to understand how these factors interact to influence flood risk.

In areas like the Congo Basin, where rainfall patterns and land cover changes significantly impact flood dynamics, integrating these datasets can provide valuable insights. For example, deforestation can increase runoff and reduce soil absorption, exacerbating flood risks. Therefore, understanding the relationship between rainfall and land cover is crucial for effective flood risk management.

## 5. Conclusion

This project successfully utilizes CHIRPS and Landsat data to assess flood risk in the Congo Basin. By analyzing rainfall patterns and land cover changes, the project identifies sub-basins most vulnerable to flooding and provides valuable insights for targeted flood risk management. The integration of high-resolution precipitation data with detailed land cover information enhances the accuracy of flood risk assessments, leading to more effective mitigation strategies and resource allocation.

Future work may focus on expanding the analysis to include additional factors such as topography and land use changes, as well as applying the methodology to other regions affected by flooding.
