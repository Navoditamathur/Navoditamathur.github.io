About Me
------
I am an AI researcher with expertise at the intersection of AI, life sciences, and geospatial analytics. With over a year of experience in machine learning and three years in software development, my work focuses on building AI-driven solutions for healthcare and environmental challenges. My key projects include:

Agentic AI for Disease Prediction – Integrating EHR, medical imaging, and knowledge graphs to enhance clinical decision-making.<br/>
Medical Image Analysis – Optimizing Swin-UNETR for 3D brain tumor segmentation.<br/>
Wildfire Risk Classification – Developing smoke detection models for fire-prone region assessment.<br/>
Environmental Monitoring – Leveraging Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to detect deforestation.<br/>

Key Research Projects
------

- Brain Tumor Image Segmentation:
Developed an advanced classification model utilizing Swin transformers and attention mechanisms to accurately segment and classify brain tumors.
- Road Crack Image Segmentation:
Implemented a novel approach using discrete wavelet transforms and self-attention mechanisms to detect and segment road cracks with high precision.

Research Experience 
----

As a Machine Learning Engineer (Volunteer) at Omdena, I contribute to AI-driven solutions addressing critical social and environmental issues. My work involves developing end-to-end ML pipelines for projects such as:
- Yield Prediction & Flood Forecasting – Enhancing agricultural productivity and disaster preparedness using AI.
- Deforestation Monitoring – Leveraging Sentinel-2 imagery and vegetation indices for forest conservation.
  
I specialize in computer vision, remote sensing, and machine learning, developing solutions that drive real-world impact.
